                                I am a passionate software developer ready to give anything I have to any endeavor.
                                My main expertise is in web development. But I&apos;m not just a web developer; occasionally,
                                I also develop desktop applications. I value both innovation and creativity.

                                I was first introduced to programming through Visual Basic 6 when I was in GCE Ordinary level.
                                I discovered a passion for creating incredible things and I embraced it.
                                I tried to learn how to make applicationsÂ but failed due to a lack of information
                                and resources until I reached the GCE Advanced level.

                                Since then, I&apos;ve devoted my life to mastering the art of better coding and using my coding skills to
                                produce amazing things that will alter the course of history. To prepare for my purpose,
                                I have been conducting research and exercising. I guess I have accomplished my task.
