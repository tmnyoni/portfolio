                            My name is Tawanda M. Nyoni. I am a software
                            developer based in Harare. I speciliaze in web
                            development, Mobile and Desktop apps development.I
                            am currently working at Claxon Acturies. I almost

                            I like calling myself a full-stack developer,
                            because I develop both frontend and backend. My
                            stack usually includes python & TypeScript. But I
                            have also developed applications in C++ and Java

                            I spend most of my time developing applications, and
                            I also like playing games. And drinking coffee, of
                            course, I mean ðŸ˜‰.
