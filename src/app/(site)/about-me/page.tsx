                            Hello, I am Tawanda M. Nyoni, a Harare-based
                            software developer extraordinaire. I work on web
                            development, mobile and desktop apps, and data
                            analysis. You name it, and I code it. I work at
                            Claxon Acturies, where I make magic happen with
                            numbers and algorithms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As if being a software developer extraordinaire
                            wasn&apos;t enough, I&apos;m also a brilliant UI &
                            UX designer. I have a passion for colors and fonts,
                            and I know how to make them work together in
                            harmony. I like drawing lines and circles, because
                            they are the essence of design. I also do
                            photography, because I&apos;m a visual storyteller.
                            Just say hi, and I&apos;ll blow your mind with my
                            amazing stories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I&apos;m a full-stack developer, which means
                            I&apos;m equally adept at frontend and backend
                            development. Python and TypeScript are my favorite
                            tools, but I can also use C++ and Java when I feel
                            like torturing myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I&apos;m not busy creating awesome
                            applications, I like to play games and drink coffee.
                            Because, you know, I&apos;m a normal human being
                            with hobbies and caffeine addiction. That&apos;s me
                            in a nutshell. Nice to meet you ðŸ˜‰.
