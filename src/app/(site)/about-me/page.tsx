                                Hello there, world. Tawanda M. Nyoni here, a
                                Harare-based software developer extraordinaire.
                                I work on web development, mobile and desktop
                                apps, and data analysis. You name it, and I code
                                it. I work at Claxon Acturies, where I make
                                magic happen with numbers and algorithms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As if being a software developer extraordinaire
                                wasn&apos;t enough, I&apos;m also a brilliant UI
                                & UX designer. I have a passion for colors and
                                fonts, and I know how to make them work together
                                in harmony. I like drawing lines and circles,
                                because they are the essence of design. I also
                                do photography, because I&apos;m a visual
                                storyteller. Just say hi, and I&apos;ll blow
                                your mind with my amazing stories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I&apos;m a full-stack developer, which means
                                I&apos;m equally adept at frontend and backend
                                development. Python and TypeScript are my
                                favorite tools, but I can also use C++ and Java
                                when I feel like torturing myself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I&apos;m not busy creating awesome
                                applications, I like to play games and drink
                                coffee. Because, you know, I&apos;m a normal
                                human being with hobbies and caffeine addiction.
                                That&apos;s me in a nutshell. Nice to meet you
                                ðŸ˜‰.
                            </p>

                                Just so you know, I&apos;m not that great at
                                English, and my sarcasm is pretty lame. But hey,
                                I&apos;m a good prompt engineer. Do you even
                                know what that is? You should google it, maybe
                                you&apos;ll learn something. And while
                                you&apos;re at it,{" "}
